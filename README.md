Challenge Assignment 15 - Leaflet

# Data

The data I chose was the last 30 days (month) of earthquakes at least 4.5 in magnitude. It is from the U.S. Government and comes in `JSON` format. It is fetched in the `logic.js` file.

# Leaflet Map Creation

* The depth of the earthquake is indicated by the color - green is more shallow and red is deeper into the Earth. 
* The size of our marker indicates the magnitude. Larger marker = higher magnitude
* If you click on a marker, you will see the approximate location, the depth, and the magnitude of the earthquake.
* A legend was added for the color scale
* I also published to github pages for easier viewing - Link below
